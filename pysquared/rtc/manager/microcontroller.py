"""This module provides a manager for the Microcontroller's Real-Time Clock (RTC).

This module defines the `MicrocontrollerManager` class, which provides an interface
for interacting with the microcontroller's built-in RTC. It allows for setting
the current time.

**Usage:**
```python
rtc_manager = MicrocontrollerManager()
rtc_manager.set_time(2024, 7, 8, 10, 30, 0, 1) # Set to July 8, 2024, 10:30:00 AM, Monday
```
